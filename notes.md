MN-CSS

the name: MN because Minnesota is both a cool place and where the devs making this live - Also mn is short, and a shortened version of Min or minimalist, which is a good descriptor of the philosophy this project intends to embrace.

The inspirations:
pico.css https://picocss.com/
water.css https://watercss.kognise.dev/
missing.style https://missing.style/
milligram https://milligram.io/
mini.css https://minicss.us/docs.htm
bolt.css https://boltcss.com/
dev.css https://tangled.org/devins.page/dev.css

daisyUI https://daisyui.com/
shadcn-classless https://nandaleio.github.io/shadcn-classless/#introdution
Materialize https://materializecss.com/typography.html

meta list of others: https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css 

Goals: 
More modern than Pico.css - Un-Sass-ify it with a more modern CSS syntax approach, in some ways like water.css but including more and deeper styles than water. less complex than daisyui and without a reliance on a heavy and CSS hostile dependency like Tailwind

un-tooling. not just Sass, but Tailwind, UnoCSS etc are all so complicated,  a bit of atomic css utilities on top of some classless CSS, some basic CSS componentization, NO BUILD tool, no distribution stack, just text files that can be copied, and then modified.
